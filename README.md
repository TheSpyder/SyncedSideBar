This plugin highlights all files.

Usage
-----

#### Note

This plugin works on both Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3 beta. The new capabilities enabled by ST3 are designed to gracefully degrade to the old behaviour on ST2.

When running on ST3 build 3025 or above, the plugin tracks the sidebar visibility. It still forces the sidebar to become visible the first time a window is opened in each Sublime session, but after that the plugin will detect when the sidebar is hidden and stop calling "reveal_in_side_bar" until it is shown again. It will even remember the visible state for each window in a multi-window editing session.

### Configuration

SyncedSideBar enables/disables automatic syncing via the setting `reveal-on-activate`.

If `true`, syncing will automatically happen. If `false`, syncing will be disabled.

Helper commands for enabling/disabling automatic syncing are available as 'Side Bar: Enable Sync' and 'Side Bar: Disable Sync'.

This can be found in the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux/Windows).

### Manually reveal files

Files can be manually revealed via the command 'Side Bar: Reveal File'.

This can be found in the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux/Windows).
